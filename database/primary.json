It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle since LLVM 2.6.\nIt is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), supporting most of its compilation flags and unofficial language extensions.[8][9] Its contributors include Apple, Microsoft, Google, ARM, Sony, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It is open-source software,[10] with source code released under the University of Illinois/NCSA License, a permissive free software licence. Since v9.0.0, it was relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.[4]\nClang 12, the latest major version of Clang as of April 2021, has full support for all published C++ standards up to C++17, implements most features of C++20, and adds initial support for the upcoming C++23 standard.[11] Since v6.0.0, Clang compiles C++ using the GNU++14 dialect by default, which includes features from the C++14 standard and conforming GNU extensions.[12]\nThe Clang project includes the Clang front end, a static analyzer, and several code analysis tools.[13]\n"
